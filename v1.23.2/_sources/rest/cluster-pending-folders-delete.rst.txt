DELETE /rest/cluster/pending/folders
====================================

.. versionadded:: 1.18.0

Remove records about a pending folder announced from a remote device.  Valid
values for the ``folder`` and ``device`` parameters are those from the
corresponding :doc:`cluster-pending-folders-get` endpoint.  The ``device``
parameter is optional and affects announcements of this folder from the given
device, or from *any* device if omitted.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -X DELETE -H "X-API-Key: abc123" http://localhost:8384/rest/cluster/pending/folders?folder=cpkn4-57ysy&device=P56IOI7-MZJNU2Y-IQGDREY-DM2MGTI-MGL3BXN-PQ6W5BM-TBBZ4TJ-XZWICQ2

Returns status 200 and no content upon success, or status 500 and a plain text
error on failure.  A :doc:`/events/pendingfolderschanged` event will be
generated in response.

For a more permanent effect, also for future announcements of the same folder
ID, the folder should be ignored in the :doc:`configuration </users/config>`
instead.
