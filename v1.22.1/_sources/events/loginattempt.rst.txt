LoginAttempt
------------

When authentication is enabled for the GUI, this event is emitted on every
login attempt. If either the username or password are incorrect, ``success``
is false and in any case the given username is returned.  The included
remote address concerns the immediate connecting host, which may not be the
origin of the request, but e.g. a reverse proxy.
