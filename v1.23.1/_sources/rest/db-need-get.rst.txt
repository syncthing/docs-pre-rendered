GET /rest/db/need
=================

Takes one mandatory parameter, ``folder``, and returns lists of files which are
needed by this device in order for it to become in sync.

The results can be paginated using the :ref:`common pagination parameters
<rest-pagination>`.  Pagination happens, across the union of all needed files,
that is - across all 3 sections of the response.  For example, given the current
need state is as follows:

1. ``progress`` has 15 items
2. ``queued`` has 3 items
3. ``rest`` has 12 items

If you issue a query with ``page=1`` and ``perpage=10``, only the ``progress``
section in the response will have 10 items. If you issue a request query with
``page=2`` and ``perpage=10``, ``progress`` section will have the last 5 items,
``queued`` section will have all 3 items, and ``rest`` section will have first
2 items. If you issue a query for ``page=3`` and ``perpage=10``, you will only
have the last 10 items of the ``rest`` section.

.. note:: Return format changed in version 0.14.43, removing the ``total`` count
          attribute.
